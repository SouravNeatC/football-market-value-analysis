The final analysis explores the relationship between performance and market value across five European giants:

Performance scores are calculated using weighted Z-scores (measuring relative performance compared to others in the same role).

### Forwards (FWD)
- 40% Goals scored per 90 minutes
- 15% Non-penalty xG per 90
- 10% xG per 90
- 10% Assists per 90
- 10% Expected assists (xAG) per 90
- 5% Progressive carries per 90
- 10% Progressive passes received per 90
- Discipline penalty: â€“5% (yellow and red cards, with red cards weighted more heavily)

### Midfielders (MF)
- 25% Shot-creating actions per 90
- 20% Progressive passes per 90
- 15% Progressive carries per 90
- 5% Progressive passes received per 90
- 10% Assists per 90
- 10% Passes attempted per 90
- 10% Pass completion percentage
- 5% Tackles per 90
- 5% Interceptions per 90

### Defenders (DF)
- 20% Interceptions per 90
- 20% Tackles per 90
- 15% Blocks per 90
- 15% Clearances per 90

- 10% Progressive passes received per 90
- Discipline penalty: â€“5% (same method as forwards)

### Goalkeepers (GK)
- 40% Save percentage
- 20% Clean sheet percentage
- 10% Crosses stopped %
- 10% Defensive actions outside penalty area
- 5% Average distance of defensive actions
- 10% Save percentage on penalties

Underrated Player Ranking

An "underrated" score is calculated as:

Performance Score Ã· Market Value (in euros)

This highlights players who deliver strong performances relative to their transfer value.


Eligibility conditions

A player is only considered for the underrated ranking if:

They have played at least 20 full 90s.
Their market value is available and greater than zero.
Their age is under 30.
They have a clearly identified role (FWD, MF, DF, GK).
